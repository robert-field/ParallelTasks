**Using GNU Make to run parallel processes**

The GNU version of the `make` program has an option, `-j`, which tells
`make` how many processes to run in parallel.  Sometimes using it with
make files not designed for parallel execution can lead to nasty
surprises.

**Use Case**

But here we will just be using `make` to run a large group of
`sample_client` instances.  The use case would be to run many similar
tasks that can be parallelized without interaction.  For example,
generate images for a video, where each image requires a run of a
program.

**Generating the Makefile**

The Makefile will be generated by a program, `gen_makefile.py`, which,
to use our video example, would know the number of images that need to
be created, and any additional parameters required.
